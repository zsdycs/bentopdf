        <h2>1. Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          BentoPDF ("we", "us", "our") is fundamentally a privacy-focused
          service. This Privacy Policy outlines our unwavering commitment to
          protecting your privacy. Our core principle is simple:
          <strong>your files are your files</strong>. We do not and cannot
          view, access, store, or share your documents. All PDF processing
          occurs entirely on your own computer, within your web browser
          (client-side).
        </p>

        <h3>1.1 The Client-Side Principle</h3>
        <p>
          Unlike other online PDF services, BentoPDF does not upload your
          files to a server for processing. The tools you use are powered by
          JavaScript and WebAssembly libraries that run directly on your
          device. This means your data never leaves your computer, providing
          you with the highest level of privacy and security.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>
          Because of our client-side architecture, we are technically
          incapable of collecting the following information:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The content of your PDF files or any other documents you use with
            our tools.
          </li>
          <li>Any personal data contained within your documents.</li>
          <li>Filenames of your documents.</li>
          <li>
            Any derived information or metadata from your files, beyond what
            is necessary for the tool to function during your active session
            (and this is immediately discarded).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Information We May Collect (Non-Personal Data)</h2>
        <p>
          To improve our website and services, we may collect anonymous,
          non-personally identifiable information. This type of data helps us
          understand how users interact with our site, which tools are most
          popular, and how we can improve the user experience. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> Anonymized data such as which
            tools are used, how often they are used, and which features are
            accessed. This is aggregated and cannot be tied back to an
            individual user or document.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance Data:</strong> Anonymized error reports or
            performance metrics to help us identify and fix bugs. This data
            contains no personal information or file content.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We use privacy-respecting analytics platforms for this purpose.
          Specifically, we use
          <a href="https://simpleanalytics.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            class="text-indigo-400 hover:underline">Simple Analytics</a>
          to track anonymous visit counts. This means we can see how many
          users visit our site, but
          <strong>we never collect personal information or identify individual
            users</strong>. Simple Analytics is fully GDPR-compliant and respects user
          privacy. We do not use tracking cookies for advertising or
          cross-site profiling.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Libraries</h2>
        <p>
          BentoPDF is built using powerful, open-source libraries like
          PDF-lib.js and PDF.js. These libraries are trusted by developers
          worldwide and operate under the same client-side principle. While we
          have vetted these libraries, we encourage you to review their
          respective privacy policies for your own peace of mind.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>
          Since your files are never transmitted over the internet to our
          servers, you are protected from potential data breaches during
          transit or storage on a server. The security of your documents is in
          your hands and protected by the security of your own computer and
          web browser.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Our services are not directed at individuals under the age of 13. We
          do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If
          you believe a child has provided us with personal information,
          please contact us, and we will take steps to delete such
          information.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify
          you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page and
          updating the "Last Updated" date at the top. You are advised to
          review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
        </p>
